		<h2>It All Started Up One Weekend .... </h2>
		<p>The UserBallot team met at the first ever <a href="http://trivalley.startupweekend.org" target="_blank">Tri-Valley Startup Weekend</a> in September 2013. We saw a need for companies to gather feedback from users in the most lightweight mannner possible. Just two days later, UserBallot was born.</p>
		<p>Our guiding principles are:
		<ul><li>Users shouldn't have to work at giving you feedback.</li>
		<li>Developers shouldn't need to be social or mass media experts</li>
		<li>Business owners shouldn't need an advanced degree in informatics to know what their users want</li>
		<li>Any product you need to add to your own application should be, well, worth adding to your application</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
